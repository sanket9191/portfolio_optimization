ðŸš€ Adaptive Portfolio Optimization via Unsupervised Learning

This project implements a portfolio optimization strategy that leverages:

    Fama-French Factors and RSI-based clustering to identify optimal stock clusters.
    Max Sharpe Ratio Optimization using the Efficient Frontier for stock weight allocation.
    Rolling Beta Calculation with a dynamic 12-24 month window to capture time-varying factor exposures.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Performance Metrics

    Annualized Return (Strategy): 21.82% (vs Nifty: 10.36%)
    Sharpe Ratio (Strategy): 0.78 (vs Nifty: 0.37)
    Max Drawdown (Strategy): -36.08% (vs Nifty: -40.04%)

ðŸ“Š Project Workflow

    Data preprocessing and factor-based feature extraction.
    Clustering stocks using RSI-based centroids and K-Means.
    Rolling beta estimation and factor exposure adjustment.
    Stock weight optimization using Max Sharpe Ratio.
    Performance benchmarking against NIFTY 50.
